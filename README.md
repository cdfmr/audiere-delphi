This is the Delphi interface of my unofficial fork of [Audiere](https://github.com/cdfmr/audiere) library.

**Audiere.pas**

Load audiere.dll dynamically (default) or link it to executables (remote DYNAMIC definition).

**AudiereEmbedded.pas**

Embed audiere.dll into executables as resource and load it dynamically.
